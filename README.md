# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/UI + Tanstack Router

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working with my favourite component library and my favourite router.

Sometimes when i just want to make a quick test project i don't waste 15 minutes adding Tailwind and ShadCN/ui and i just clone this repo.
